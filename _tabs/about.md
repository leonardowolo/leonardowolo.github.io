# ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

I'm Leonardo Wolo, a Cloud Engineer with a passion for technology and innovation. I'm specialize in building and managing cloud-native infrastructure using tools like AWS, Terraform, and Kubernetes.

At ACA Group, Iâ€™ve worked on automating CI/CD pipelines, deploying secure and scalable systems, and implementing observability using modern monitoring stacks. I enjoy solving complex problems and turning ideas into robust, efficient solutions.

When Iâ€™m not working, youâ€™ll often find me experimenting in my homelab, diving into new tech, or refining my skills through hands-on projects.

Thanks for stopping by!
